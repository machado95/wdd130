        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The Home Page will be our propaganda page and will have some simple and important information. We will have a summary of the services offered, the main pets that we attend, a brief explanation of how much would it cost and why should they hire our services.
        The first information would be about our mission, vision and values. We will assure our visitors that we have the mission to provide the best attendance and care services to their pets, with the assistance of professional employees, in order to protect their animals. We will show our vision of being a reference in the services provided to domestic animals. Also, we will show our values of being kind and protective to the pets and to always put them at first, when an emergency arises. We believe that explaining our mission, vision and values will give confidence to our visitors because they will see that we have principles and that we focus to take care of their animals, rather than focusing only on the money.
        Right after we will use some pictures and some texts to briefly explain our services of accommodation, recreation, pet sitter and so on. They will be able to see that we have plenty of services to satisfy their needs and their animal’s needs. They will feel confident that their pets will come back home better than when they hired our services.
        We will show some clients evaluations sided to their rating to our services, giving the visitors more credibility to the work we do. We will show at least one evaluation for each type of service provided, that the visitors might see the quality of every service and the professionalism of our team.
        In the footer we will provide links to the second and third pages, our social media and phone numbers to contact us, if they want.

We will provide answers concerning how much would cost every kind of service we provide, what are the benefits of hiring each service, what are the differences of one service to the other, why should they hire our services rather than other companies’ and so on. We will use some pictures to illustrate the ideas we will try to explain them and to make them feel more comfortable and safe about choosing our services.
